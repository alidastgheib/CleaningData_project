# Getting and Cleaning Data using R 
This script is written for the assignment project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data course" at coursera. The R script (run_analysis.R) is used to clean the raw downloaded data file. In the following, we will shortly inform how the code works:

1. x_train and x_test are read and then are combined together (created x_total).
2. y_train and y_test are read and then are combined together (created y_total).
